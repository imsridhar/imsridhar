### **📢 I'm seeking Pre-doc opportunities in Systems and applied ML roles**

<hr>

### Hi there 👋

My name is Sridhar, and I am a Grad Computer Science student at the IIIT Hyderabad. 

- 🔭 I work on computer architecture + real-time systems
- 🌱 I’m currently working on Checkpointing frequency optimization while maintaining data freshness for a task chain based system 
- 👯 I’m looking for collaborators on my projects. If that's you, let's get in touch. 
- 💬 Ask me about anime, manga, and computer systems.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

- ⚙️ Previously I was at [Cerebras Systems](https://cerebras.net) as a **Machine Learning Frameworks Software Engineer Intern**, where I worked on integrating [PyTorch](http://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/) with the [Cerebras CS-2 System](https://www.cerebras.net/product-system/) — the world's fastest AI accelerator.

- 🛠️ At Cerebras, I made significant contributions to open-source projects, such as [Torch-MLIR](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir) (supported by the LLVM Project and Google), and [PyTorch](http://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/). I primarily worked on creating the Lazy Tensor Core frontend for Torch-MLIR (read more about it [here](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir/blob/main/docs/ltc_backend.md)), and integrating it with our highly specialized compiler and execution pipeline.

- 💻 I'm currently serving as a Board Member for [Hack the 6ix](https://hackthe6ix.com) — Toronto's largest summer hackathon. Prior to that, I was Co-Chair for our 2021 event, where I coordinated **27 organizers** to host **670+ attendees** from around the world. As Web Director, I also built robust web software and infrastructure to handle 4500+ users across multiple events.

- 🤖 I've worked on a number of real-time systems related projects in the past, and enjoy creating working on processor/computation/scheduling related projects

- 👔 I'm looking for Pre-doc internship opportunities for **Fall 2023**! Please contact me if you would like to have a chat 🙂.
